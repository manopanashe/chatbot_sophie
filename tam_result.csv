date,Notes
20/04/2023,For very basic comands it appears to work as intended. It's not very personable and if you go off the path of normal responses it quickly doesn't know what you want. It definitely fulfils the function it is designed for though
20/04/2023,"The response on discount is not very clear. Especially when I asked for student discount.   Return info could be more specific, like including a link or something to proceed."
20/04/2023,Very good at dealing with long paragraphs. Good at dealing with different ways of asking a question    Limited responses  Limited topics  A few spelling mistakes
20/04/2023,"Interface seems to work really well, responses are quick.    UI/UX needs some work as text is cut off in some areas and Sophie's responses are hard to read due to lack of contrast between text and backgrounds colour.    Text to speech is a great inclusion!"
20/04/2023,"After some questions about returning items, exchanging items, promotions, and stores, Sophie replies in a very broad way, not specific to the question. Sophie tends to point a lot of the answers to the physical store or the contact form.    Every question is treated as a new subject, no follow ups. This could be annoying if the client is trying to get a bit more info, for example, returning a faulty item, she replies stating the item needs to be in a saleable condition. If I ask anything else, she doesn't follow up the conversation.    As for store related questions, if I can find the lifts, she just broadly answers that stores are equipped with lifts and escalators.    Asked if Primark sells toys, she pointed me to use the Contact Form or to find specific store details on the website.     Sophie also appears to be guided by specific word search, not sentences?!    Example: If I just type ""Deals"", she will reply with   ""reduced products can be identified by a 'Red' reduced sticker which displays the product new Price""    But if I type ""What deals does Primark have right now"", she replies with   ""We require our employees to be above the age of 16 years old before they can apply for a position at Primark. For more details visit our career site (https://careers.primark.com/retail)volume_up""    On the other hand, I typed ""Careers"", and she replied ""I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you."""
20/04/2023,Only looks for key words in the question therefore can miss the actual context of the question.     
20/04/2023,Sophie has potential however her information is limited when it can be fed via scraping or with other casual information. Sophie should also be able to give contact details or move someone to an agent.
21/04/2023,Sophie is informative and easy to use but it doesn't know how to behave when I use my wording incorrectly.
22/04/2023,Hello 
22/04/2023,"Overall Sophie was able to identify the key terms from the search/question and find an appropriate response/answer.    Sometimes you would have to be really specific as when I typed in ""primark career"" Sophie told me to email query or feedback. But when I typed ""job openings"" then it told me about instore and head office vacancies."
